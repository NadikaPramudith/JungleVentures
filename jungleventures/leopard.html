                <h2>The sri lankan leopard</h2><br>
                <p>The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) stands as a charismatic and endangered emblem of the
                    island's rich biodiversity. Endemic to Sri Lanka, this elusive big cat has carved its niche in a
                    variety of ecosystems, from the dense rainforests to the arid plains, showcasing its adaptability.
                    The Sri Lankan leopard's distinctive appearance is characterized by a striking golden-yellow coat
                    adorned with dark rosettes, providing effective camouflage in its lush and varied habitats. With a
                    robust build and a sleek, powerful physique, these leopards are formidable predators at the top of
                    the food chain.</p><br>
                <p>The species faces numerous threats, placing it on the brink of extinction. Habitat loss due to
                    deforestation, encroachment for agriculture, and infrastructure development has significantly
                    diminished the available living space for these leopards. Human-wildlife conflict further compounds
                    their challenges, as encounters with local communities sometimes result in retaliatory killings due
                    to perceived threats to livestock or human safety. Additionally, poaching for their magnificent
                    pelts and body parts poses a significant risk to the Sri Lankan leopard population. As a result, the
                    International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified this species as endangered.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Sri Lankan leopard, with its unique genetic lineage, serves as a flagship species for broader
                    conservation efforts in the region. Preserving this iconic predator means safeguarding the integrity
                    of entire ecosystems, as the health of the leopard population reflects the well-being of their
                    habitats. The urgency of the situation necessitates collaborative efforts on both local and global
                    scales to ensure the survival of the Sri Lankan leopard, allowing future generations to marvel at
                    the beauty and significance of this extraordinary big cat.</p><br>

                <h2>Threat to Sri lankan leopard</h2><br>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h3>
                    </li><br>
                    <p> One of the primary threats to the Sri Lankan leopard is the loss and fragmentation of its
                        natural habitat. Deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization result in the shrinking
                        of available space for the leopards, leading to habitat fragmentation. This restricts their
                        movement and can increase human-wildlife conflict.</p><br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Human-Wildlife Conflict</h3>
                    </li><br>
                    <p>As human populations expand and encroach upon leopard habitats, conflicts arise. Leopards may
                        prey on livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by farmers protecting their livelihoods. The
                        loss of natural prey due to habitat degradation can also drive leopards to target domestic
                        animals.</p><br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade</h3>
                    </li><br>
                    <p>The Sri Lankan leopard is threatened by poaching for its skin, bones, and other body parts,
                        driven by demand in illegal wildlife trade markets. The high value placed on leopard parts
                        contributes to the illegal hunting and trade of these endangered animals</p><br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Road Kill and Accidents</h3>
                    </li><br>
                    <p>Infrastructure development, including roads passing through leopard habitats, poses a threat to
                        these big cats. Increased vehicular traffic can result in leopard fatalities due to collisions,
                        impacting the population and genetic diversity.</p><br>

                <h2>Actions taken to mitigate the threats</h2><br>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Protected Areas and Habitat Conservation</h3>
                    </li><br>
                    <p>Establishing and maintaining protected areas and wildlife reserves play a critical role in
                        providing safe habitats for the Sri Lankan leopard. Strict conservation measures within these
                        areas help minimize habitat loss and fragmentation, ensuring that leopards have sufficient space
                        to roam and access prey.</p><br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Anti-Poaching Measures</h3>
                    </li><br>
                    <p>Strengthening anti-poaching efforts is crucial to combat the illegal trade in leopard parts and
                        prevent poaching incidents. This involves increasing law enforcement patrols in leopard
                        habitats, implementing stricter penalties for poaching offenses, and collaborating with
                        international organizations to curb the demand for illegal wildlife products.</p><br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Research and Monitoring</h3>
                    </li><br>
                    <p>Ongoing research on Sri Lankan leopards helps gather essential data on their behavior, population
                        dynamics, and habitat requirements. This information is crucial for developing targeted
                        conservation strategies and understanding how the leopards interact with their environment</p>
