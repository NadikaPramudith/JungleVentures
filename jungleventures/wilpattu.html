                <h4 class="animated-text">Nestled along the captivating southeastern coast of Sri Lanka, Yala National
                    Park beckons nature enthusiasts and wildlife aficionados alike. Covering an expansive 97,800
                    hectares, it stands as the second-largest national park in the country, embracing a mosaic of
                    ecosystems that range from dense forests to sprawling grasslands and coastal lagoons. What sets Yala
                    apart is its reputation as a haven for biodiversity, notably housing a thriving population of Sri
                    Lankan leopards, drawing global attention for unparalleled leopard sightings. Beyond the elusive big
                    cats, the park is a sanctuary for a diverse array of wildlife, offering visitors a mesmerizing
                    glimpse into the untamed wonders of the natural world. Embarking on guided safaris, visitors not
                    only revel in the sheer beauty of Yala's landscapes but also contribute to the ongoing conservation
                    efforts dedicated to preserving this extraordinary habitat.</h4>

                <h2>Introduction to Wilpattu</h2><br>
                <br>
                <p>Welcome to the lush wilderness of Wilpattu National Park (WNP). Ranging over 131 thousand hectares,
                    it is Sri Lanka’s largest and one of the oldest protected areas. The park consists of five blocks
                    declared between 1938-1973 under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and is managed by the
                    Department of Wildlife Conservation.

                    WNP spans across the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, and borders the Mannar and Vavuniya
                    Districts. The area is one of the most important elephant habitats in the country and is also a
                    great place to observe the elusive Sri Lankan leopard and the sloth bear.

                    This park has a denser forest cover unlike many other National Parks in Sri Lanka. WNPs landscape
                    comprises of dry zone forests and thorny scrub interspersed with extensive open plains, sand dunes
                    and the unique Villu wetlands. Bare reddish cliffs rising abruptly from narrow beaches of the
                    Portugal Bay and Dutch Bay are another striking feature of its landscape.

                    WNP is in the proximity to the ancient historical city of Anuradhapura and houses several ancient
                    ruins and artifacts from various periods of history.</p>

                <h2>History & Places of Interest</h2><br>
                <br>
                <p>Archeological structures scattered around the park including tanks, Buddhist monasteries, stupas, and
                    rock inscriptions, give evidence of a civilization based on irrigated agriculture that was present
                    in the region. Thambapanni, where King Vijaya supposedly landed in about 500 BC and founded the
                    Sinhalese people, is said to be in WNP between Kudiramale point and Moderagam Aru river mouth.

                    Galbendi Neeravia, located North-East of Maradanmaduwa tank is supposed to be the place where Prince
                    Saliya, the son of King Dutugemunu, lived with his bride Asokamaala 2,000 years ago. Further,
                    prehistoric sites of the Paleolithic and Mesolithic period have also been recorded.</p><br>
