                <h2>SRI LANKAN SLOTH BEAR</h2>
                <p>The Sri Lankan sloth bear (Melursus ursinus inornatus ) is a subspecies of the sloth bear which is
                    found mainly in lowland dry forests in the island of Sri Lanka.The Sri Lankan sloth bear is highly
                    threatened, with a population less than 1000 (the wild population may be as few as 500) in many
                    isolated populations with population decrease. Destruction of dry-zone natural forest is its main
                    threat because unlike other large Sri Lankan animals, the Sri Lankan sloth bear is highly dependent
                    on natural forests for its food source. An increase in sloth bear-human interaction has also caused
                    many conflicts. These conflicts include death and injury to humans, livestock loss, damage to
                    property, and retaliatory killing of wildlife causing humans to fear this species</p>

                <h2>SRI LANKA BLUE MAGPIE</h2>
                <p>The Sri Lanka blue magpie or Ceylon magpie (Urocissa ornata ) is a brightly coloured member of the
                    family Corvidae, found exclusively in Sri Lanka. This species is adapted to hunting in the dense
                    canopy, where it is highly active and nimble. Its flight is rather weak, though, and is rarely used
                    to cover great distances. In spite of the Sri Lanka blue magpie's ability to adapt to the presence
                    of humans, it is classified as vulnerable to extinction due to the fragmentation and destruction of
                    its habitat of dense primary forest in the wet zone of southern Sri Lanka.</p>

                <h2>SRI LANKAN KRAIT</h2>
                <p>The Sri Lankan krait is small and slender. On hatching, the length of the snake is about 250 mm (9.8
                    in). The average adult length for this species is 75 cm (29+1⁄2 in) with 90 cm (35+1⁄2 in) being the
                    upper limit.Its black skin is crossed with thin white transverse bands. It has an extraordinarily
                    long lung which it inflates when angry.It is very slow and sluggish by day. At night it may strike
                    after considerable provocation, but behaves quite the contrary by day, often allowing itself to be
                    handled or even bullied with impunity. During such rough treatment it usually does nothing but puff
                    up its lung to display its discomfort.</p>

                <h2>CHESTNUT-BACKED OWLET</h2>
                <p>The chestnut-backed owlet (Glaucidium castanotum ) (often misspelled Glaucidium castanonotum ), is an
                    owl which is endemic to Sri Lanka. This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as
                    typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most of the smaller owl species. This species was formerly
                    considered to be a subspecies of the jungle owlet. Historical reports of its distribution by Legge
                    include many parts of the southern half of Sri Lanka, especially the hills and the wet-zone low
                    country extending to the outskirts of Colombo. In recent times, its range has shrunk greatly, and it
                    is now found sparingly in the remaining forests of the wet zone and the adjoining hills at altitudes
                    of up to 6500 ft above sea level.</p>
